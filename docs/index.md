# Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service)

Welcome, Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service) is a newer form of innovation. It is intended to be a <b> design pattern/reference architecture/accelerator </b> built atop industry leading software. The sole purpose of ALL the capabilities we have enabled for healthcare is enable <b> Data as an Asset</b>.

## General Background

For far too long healthcare has struggled with being able to address the basic task of accessing information quickly to help drive business decisions and capabilities. The typical focus across healthcare, has been and is, around the software providers enabling access to data via some form of integration, their technology, canned reports or other various capabilities. However, there is a growing business and technology requirements and need in near real-time for data access. For most types of organizations integration continues to be considered a very frustrating and sunk cost needed for business purposes. However, over the last decade its importance has grown substantially based on the current landscape shifts involving: 

* Increasing mandates: at varying levels (Federal, State, Province, etc.) or changes in funding or contractual obligations.
* Healthcare comeptition: Companies that are competitors are now also aligning as partners. This can be due to acquisition(s), the shift into different market areas, contracts or various other drivers. 
* Innovation: There is a increasing need for companies to become more "friendly" whether that be technical or consumer based. Business is demanding more results and quicker!!!!
* "Cloud": Whether it is the healthcare and life sciences companies or the vendors that support them the Cloud is continuing to see growing adoption with varying forms of usage and implementations.

Because of these transformational changes whether you are in the administrative, clinical, financial, or life sciences areas of healthcare information can no longer be the struggle that it has been, more than ever it is now and integral part of the healthcare business. As part of our effort, we wanted to ensure a focus around bringing the best capabilities to bear with the leading open-source platforms available. We believe it is time for data to be viewed as the asset and THE innovation enabler and driver. Now is the time for Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service). It was born in January 2020 and designed as a means to help showcase how Red Hat's culture and technologies can enable healthcare and solve real world problems. Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service) can be viewed as many things due to all the capabilities it enables. Most importantly for us Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service) is all about introducing innovation through reusable frameworks, design patterns and implementations that will enable organizations to quickly start driving value with information. Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service) is about enabling organizations to make data a product and build assets on top of it. Because <b>"Data is the asset!!!"</b> Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service) is about enabling information for knowledge that can be used for action in a secure and scalable manner. Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service) is a powerful set of healthcare industry design pattern/framework that is a blueprint for connecting, processing and leveraging clinical, financial, life sciences, and other needed data at scale to build solutions for today and tomorrow in a consistent manner. The ONLY limitation is your imagination and connecting to the data!!!!

## Open Source Based Mindset

Red Hat business is built around pulling from upstream communities and making technologies more enterprise capable and secure while wrapping additional offerings around them. Our intent is, and will always remain, to enable healthcare to build, extend and deliver platforms while showcasing open-source in healthcare. Our path to do this has been different though. Since we already had very leading, popular and common upstream projects/communities such as Apache Camel, Drools, Drools Fusion, Apache Kafka/Strimzi, Kubeflow, Kubernetes/K8s and several others that are already built into very well used sunscription based offerings at Red Hat. Because of this our focus was on ensuring we could deliver reusable design patterns and frameworks (as expressed above) within Red Hat Technologies first. From Februry through November 2020 we stayed focused and not only met this objective but also helpd numerous partners stand up platforms built atop this offering. In November 2020 we started planning to build out the vast amount of Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service) capabilities as an upstream community itself
<a href="https://github.com/Project-Herophilus" target="_blank">Project-Herophilus</a>. As we surveyed the healthcare community we believe this is the right move for this effort long term. Also, by doing this we are already starting to plan on other needed industry capabilities to help drive change. This will help us better support the healthcare industry and enable greater capabilities to be developed. As we start this shift here is a visual that shows how to think about this.

We are so excited about the possibilities and potential. With all this being said, <b>it was important for our code to be completely open and available with Apache 2 License!!</b>
We are sure you have doubts and questions like:           

* I already have an integration engine or enterprise application integration platform? You should not replace an existing integration engine or EAI platform, that would take time with lots of coordination. We would argue it is working for the masses then you should keep it in place. Do you view that platform as strategic or innovative though? Probably not, but it can provide access to existing information for business efforts though. Why not use it for what is good at and build innovation atop it. You can also enable innovation at an enterprise, organization or team level with this model without sacrificing security.
* I have heard all of this before and I am still not seeing any industry progress? The industry is evolving and changing. Digital in healthcare, along with several other factors, is causing the entire way healthcare data to not only be re-imagined but re-evaluated. This is forcing various changes including
  new and more modern integration standards.
* Why would you do this? Its time to help lead and drive change.

Has anyone run the risk and put their code and all their work out there for the masses to leverage in this manner? The upstream open source projects our core to our culture is all about open source and an open-source mindset. Because of this we decided to follow those practices for everything for this effort. We also have and will continue to publish onto Git Hub through our organization.

Our culture is all about open source and open source mindset because of this we decided to follow those practices for everything for this effort. All the assets are published onto Git Hub through our <a href="https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/" target="_blank"> organization</a>. Our intent is to build and enable healthcare platforms and enable an open source healthcare community. As part of this community we wanted to provide our expectations on how we expect those to behave that join the <a href="/home/CodeOfConduct" target="_blank">community</a>. 

Happy coding!!!!
