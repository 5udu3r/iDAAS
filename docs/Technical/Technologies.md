                        vibrant <a href="https://camel.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Camel</a>  community.
                        This technology is backed by one of the most active communities and continues
                        to grow and expand this technology for well over a decade. As part of its commitment there are thousands of implementations of all sizes, types and scale
                        levels in numerous industries with some of them growing to support 1 billion daily transactions. As part of its growth are the hundred plus connectors that
                        it natively supports, this will be very beneficial as connectivity will continue to be extended to more and more platforms.

                        A key effort for us is enabling and building a high end data streaming and distribution platform. This capability is being supported
                        by <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/amq" target="_blank">AMQ-Streams</a> and the upstream
                        <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank">Kafka</a> community. We are also looking at future implementations with other distributed queuing
                        technologies. As a side note, within the codebase there is a codebase
                        built atop Apache-MQ; however, we maintain the code ONLY for resources that would rather leverage that technology.

                        For APIs we have two implementations: APIs for the iDaaS design pattern and APIs to demonstrate end to end FHIR capabilities. For all API management we
                        have leveraged <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/3scale" target="_blank">3Scale</a>.

                        We currently are moving to support DDLs for SQL Server, Maria DB (MySQL) and Postgres. This is because there is wide adoption of these within healthcare.
                        The first few implementations with be SQL Server DDL centric as well finalize data model validation. We also intend to expand towards NoSQL standards
                        quickly as we continue to implement new features. Connected Health/iDaaS overall objective is to ensure we help define data as an asset.

                        When and where possible this reference aarchitecture/design pattern is completely designed to be cloud native. The ONLY exception is when we have to deal with specific
                        industry needs that cannot be done with a cloud native manner. In healthcare this refers specifically to HL7 v2 messaging. The reason is this form of messaging is legacy based on
                        the client-server socket paradigm and is meant to be long running. However, ALL any FHIR components are cloud native by design. For our container capabilities we focused
                        around the industry leading <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift" target="_blank">Openshift</a> and all the supporting OpenShift technologies.
